I use [i3blocks](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks) and this set of bash scripts to
generate my status line for the i3 window manager (for more information look at 
https://github.com/i3/i3 or https://i3wm.org).

Some additional config options are used in the i3blocks config, which I may will
document on someday. Maybe the scripts are readable enough to work with them without 
documentation.

The generated status line looks something like this:
